  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 10 requirements from the BuildRequest. The backend includes the PurchaseRequisition type with all required fields, CRUD operations with status filtering, and approval workflow methods. The frontend provides complete React Query hooks, form components for creating and editing requisitions, a table with status-based filtering and conditional actions, a detailed approval component with timeline, the main page with dialog-based creation, navigation integration with FileText icon (though specified as ClipboardList in implementation), and proper route registration. All components follow existing patterns for styling, validation, error handling, and status badges.",
